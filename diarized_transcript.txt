Speaker SPEAKER_00:  Section 4.
Speaker SPEAKER_00: You will hear a talk on the topic of time perspectives.
Speaker SPEAKER_00: First, you have some time to look at questions 31 to 40.
Speaker SPEAKER_00:  Listen carefully and answer questions 31 to 40.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Today, I'm going to be talking about time.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Specifically, I'll be looking at how people think about time and how these time perspectives structure our lives.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: According to social psychologists, there are six ways of thinking about time, which are called personal time zones.
Speaker SPEAKER_01:  The first two are based in the past.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Past positive thinkers spend most of their time in a state of nostalgia, fondly remembering moments such as birthdays, marriages, and important achievements in their life.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: These are the kinds of people who keep family records, books, and photo albums.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: People living in the past negative time zone are also absorbed by earlier times.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: But they focus on all the bad things, regrets, failures, poor decisions,
Speaker SPEAKER_01:  They spend a lot of time thinking about how life could have been.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Then, we have people who live in the present.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Present hedonists are driven by pleasure and immediate sensation.
Speaker SPEAKER_01:  Their life motto is to have a good time and avoid pain.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Present fatalists live in the moment too, but they believe this moment is the product of circumstances entirely beyond their control.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: It's their fate, whether it's poverty, religion, or society itself.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Something stops these people from believing they can play a role in changing their outcomes in life.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Life simply is, and that's that.
Speaker SPEAKER_01:  Looking at the future time zone, we can see that people classified as future active are the planners and go-getters.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: They work rather than play and resist temptation.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Decisions are made based on potential consequences, not on the experience itself.
Speaker SPEAKER_01:  A second future-orientated perspective, future-fatalistic, is driven by the certainty of life after death and some kind of a judgment day when they will be assessed on how virtuously they have lived and what success they have had in their lives.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Okay, let's move on.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: You might ask, how do these time zones affect our lives?
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Well, let's start at the beginning.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Everyone is brought into this world as a present hedonist.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: No exceptions.
Speaker SPEAKER_01:  Our initial needs and demands to be warm, secure, fed, and watered all stem from the present moment.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: But things change when we enter formal education.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: We're taught to stop existing in the moment and to begin thinking about future outcomes.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: But did you know that every nine seconds a child in the USA drops out of school?
Speaker SPEAKER_01: For boys, the rate is much higher than for girls.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: We could easily say, ah, well, boys just aren't as bright as girls.
Speaker SPEAKER_01:  But the evidence doesn't support this.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: A recent study states that boys in America, by the age of 21, have spent 10,000 hours playing video games.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: The research suggests that they'll never fit in the traditional classroom because these boys require a situation where they have the ability to manage their own learning environment.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Now, let's look at the way we do prevention education.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: All prevention education is aimed at a future time zone.
Speaker SPEAKER_01:  We say, don't smoke or you'll get cancer.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Get good grades or you won't get a good job.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: But with present-orientated kids, that just doesn't work.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Although they understand the potentially negative consequences of their actions, they persist with the behavior because they're not living for the future.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: They're in the moment right now.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: We can't use logic, and it's no use reminding them of potential fallout from their decisions or previous errors of judgment.
Speaker SPEAKER_01:  we've got to get in their minds just as they're about to make a choice.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Time perspectives make a big difference in how we value and use our time.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: When Americans are asked how busy they are, the vast majority report being busier than ever before.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: They admit to sacrificing their relationships, personal time, and a good night's sleep for their success.
Speaker SPEAKER_01:  Twenty years ago, 60% of Americans had sit-down dinners with their families.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: And now, only 20% do.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: But when they're asked what they would do with an eight-day week, they say, oh, that'd be great.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: They would spend that time laboring away to achieve more.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: They're constantly trying to get ahead, to get toward a future point of happiness.
Speaker SPEAKER_01:  So, it's really important to be aware of how other people think about time.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: We tend to think, oh, that person's really irresponsible, or that guy's power hungry.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: But often, what we're looking at is not fundamental differences of personality, but really just different ways of thinking about time.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Seeing these conflicts as differences in time perspective, rather than distinctions of character,
Speaker SPEAKER_01:  can facilitate more effective cooperation between people, and get the most out of each person's individual strengths.
Speaker SPEAKER_00: That is the end of Section 4.
Speaker SPEAKER_00: You now have half a minute to check your answers.
Speaker SPEAKER_00:  That is the end of the listening test.
Speaker SPEAKER_00: You now have 10 minutes to transfer your answers to the listening answer sheet.
